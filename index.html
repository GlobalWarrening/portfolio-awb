        <!--Introduction (requirement 2)-->
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hello, I currently work as a shift supervisor at Starbucks. I'm from Bolingbrook but I moved out of my parents hosue a few years ago and got a small place in Naperville.
            I have two older sisters, one lives close by in Naperville and the other lives in California. My Dad just retired and my Mom works as a social worker in a hospital.
            I'm majoring in CS because I enjoy figuring out how things operate, and the satisfaction I get from solving difficult problems. The same reason the most
            frequently used apps on my phone are puzzle games. 
        </p>

        <br><br>

        <h2>What I Hope to Learn in this Course</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Better understanding of day-to-day software development and maintenance</li>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <LI>CSS</LI>
                <li>Project Management</li>
                <li>More comprehensive understanding and implementation of coding strategies</li>
            </ul>

        <br><br>

        <!--(requirement 3)-->
        <h2>My Favorite Hobby</h2>
        <p>Recently I've gotten into refurbishing furniture. Over the summer I snatched a dinning set from a family friend that was moving and wanted to get rid of it.
            I managed to get the project done and really enoyed the process of transforming it into something completely different. I unfortunately don't have the space to
            do much work in my own place, so I've had to work on these projects in my parents garage. Hopefully after this winter I'll be able to commandeer that space again
            and work on a couple other pieces of furniture I have that want to refinish. Other than that I enjoy playing soccer and golf. I also go backpacking every so often. I 
            had planned a trip to backpack the Grand Canyon last year but had to put that trip on hold, for obvious reason. So, hopefully when the current risk of the pandemic is minimized
            I'll be able to resume plans for that expedition. 
        </p>
